🌧️ Landslide Detection and Traffic Automation

A real-time safety system designed for hilly terrains and ghat sections to prevent accidents caused by landslides and poor visibility in deep curves.

🚀 Overview

This project uses ESP32, IR sensors, ADXL accelerometer, Rain sensor, and Zigbee communication to detect:

Landslides using the ADXL sensor

Rainfall intensity using the Rain sensor

Vehicle movement using IR sensors

Based on the detected conditions, the system automatically controls motorized gates and sends real-time alerts through an LCD display and Zigbee network to ensure safe and smooth traffic flow.

🧠 Key Features

Real-time monitoring of rainfall and ground movement
